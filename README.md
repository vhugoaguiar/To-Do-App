# To Do App

This simple web application serves as a notes app where users can add, edit, and delete tasks (todos). The primary goal of this project is to help the developer (author) reinforce their understanding of web development concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Features

- **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks with a title and an optional description.
- **Delete Task:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Check/Uncheck Task:** Mark tasks as done or undo the status.
- **Edit Task:** Modify the title and description of existing tasks.

## Learning Journey

This project reflects the current stage of the developer's web development learning journey. It showcases the ability to create a dynamic and interactive web page using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The code is written with simplicity and clarity in mind, demonstrating the understanding of fundamental concepts.

## Future Plans

As the developer continues to advance in their web development skills, they plan to implement additional features, including:

- **Local Storage:** Save user changes locally to persist data between sessions.
- **Backend Integration:** Explore backend technologies to enhance the application with server-side capabilities.
